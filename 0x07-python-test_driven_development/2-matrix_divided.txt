* **1. Divide a matrix**
  * [2-matrix_divided.py](./2-matrix_divided.py): Python function that divides all elements of a matrix by a common divisor.
  * Returns a new matrix representing the division of all elements of `matrix` by `div`.
  * Quotients are rounded to two decimal places.
  * If `matrix` is not a list of lists of `int`s or `float`s, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of
  integers/floats`.
  * If `matrix` contains rows of different lengths, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `Each row of the matrix must have the same size`.
  * If the divisor `div` is not an `int` or `float`, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `div must be a number`.
  * If `div` is `0`, a `ZeroDivisionError` is raised with the message `division by zero`.

* **2. Say my name**
  * [3-say_my_name.py](./3-say_my_name.py): Python function that prints a name in the format `My name is <first_name> <last_name>`.
  * If either of `first_name` or `last_name` is not a `str`, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `first_name must be a string` or `last_name must be a string`.
