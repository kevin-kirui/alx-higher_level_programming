* **6. Matrix multiplication**
  * [100-matrix_mul.py](./100-matrix_mul.py): Python function that multiplies two matrices.
  * Returns a new matrix representing the multiplication of `m_a` by `m_b`.
  * If either of `m_a` or `m_b` is empty (ie. `== []` or `== [[]]`), a `ValueError` is raised with the message `m_a can't be empty` or `m_b can't be empty`.
  * If either of `m_a` or `m_b` is not a list, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `m_a must be a list` or `m_b` must be a list.
  * If either of `m_a` or `m_b` is not a list of lists, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `m_a must be a list of lists` or `m_b must be a list of lists`.
  * If either of `m_a` or `m_b` is not a list of lists of `int`s or `float`s, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `m_a should contain only integers or floats` or `m_b should contain only integers or floats`.
  * If either of `m_a` or `m_b` contains rows of different lengths, a `TypeError` is raised with the message `each row of m_a must should be of the same size` or `each row of m_b must should be of the same size`.
  * If `m_a` and `m_b` cannot be multiplied (ie. row size of `m_a` does not match column size of `m_b`), a `ValueError` is raised with the message `m_a and m_b can't be multiplied`.
